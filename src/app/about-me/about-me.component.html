                <p>Before diving into web development, I spent many years as the head of an advertising agency. This experience taught me what it takes to conceptualize and market successful websites and apps. Now, I'm not only able to create these concepts but also bring them to life technically.</p>

                    I excel at driving projects forward and thriving in collaborative Scrum teams. I'm communicative, persistent, and always think ahead â€“ qualities that served me well during my part-time training as a web developer at Developer Akademie.<br>
                    <span style="display: inline-block; margin-top: 10px;">Valuing harmony and efficiency, I appreciate environments where everyone is committed to achieving the best results.</span> Always open to learning, adapting, and growing, I embrace flexibility and a positive approach as central to how I work.
